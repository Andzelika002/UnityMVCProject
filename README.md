UnityMVCProject

A clean, modular, and open-source Unity 3D project template using the MVC architecture.

This template provides a well-organized project structure, example scripts to help developers quickly start building Unity projects following Model-View-Controller principles. It is designed for clarity, maintainability, and ease of collaboration.

âš¡ Key Features:
- MVC Architecture: Clear separation of Models, Views, and Controllers.
- Open-Source Friendly: Structured for contribution and learning.
- Unity Version: 2022.3.53f1 LTS (3D Build-in Render Pipeline).

ðŸ’¡ Rule of Thumb:
Placeholder explanation scripts (e.g., Prefabs.cs) are optional â€” remove in production.
Use logical subfolders: Group by asset type or usage, not by asset name. Keed in mind: wide hierarchy + shallow is better for small projects or templates. deep hierarchy + structured is better for large projects with hundreds/thousands of assets.
Maintain consistent naming conventions for clarity (PascalCase for scripts, descriptive names for prefabs/materials).

ðŸ“‚ MainProject Folder :
The MainProject folder contains all core project content for the UnityMVCProject template. It serves as the central location for scripts, prefabs, scenes, and other assets that define the projectâ€™s structure and functionality.
